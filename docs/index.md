# Welcome to Vern's Fantasy High Wiki

## Navigating
On the left is the various pages on the wiki. On the right is the table of contents for the page you're on. And in the middle is the page you're currently on. 

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, ask Vern to help you set it up. There's two ways you can contribute: via github online (much quicker, but harder to make big changes) or via coding it with VSCode and git and stuff (lets you make new pages).
